# machine-learning-examples

Repository destinated to expose the examples for deep learning for my projects.

regressor-2d-2d:
===

Simple DNN approach for regression of a 2d to 2d field. The intention is to map camera coordinates to motor angles for a simple aided shooting machine.
Application is in another repository :)


SIGID-fm-vs-noise-090-accuracy:
===

Simple DNN approach for a classifier of signal or FM signal. 


SIGID-fm-vs-noise-problem-loading-weights:
===

Simple DNN approach for a classifier of signal or FM signal, with another .pynb to just load the model and use them.
Actually it has a problem because it does'nt seem to apply the loaded weights, because predictions in the notebook for just use the networks does'nt predict right, but weights seems to be the same.
