# machine-learning-examples

Repository destinated to expose the examples for deep learning for my projects.

regressor-2d-2d:
===

Simple DNN approach for regression of a 2d to 2d field. The intention is to map camera coordinates to motor angles for a simple aided shooting machine.
Application is in another repository :)

SIGID-fm-vs-noise-090-accuracy:
===

Simple DNN approach for a classifier of signal or FM signal, based on a raw iq samples value small sample. 

SIGID-fm-vs-noise-092:
===

Simple DNN approach for a classifier of signal or FM signal (stripped, minimal), based on a raw iq samples value small sample. 

SIGID-GRC-capturer
===

Example for capturing signals. Does'nt work actually, just uploaded for backup and continue working on it.
