<shine|bm> well. the rest of the parties i mentioned are just 'normal' parties... strange. the coolest 
  parties are - just by accident- right after your exams... =)

  argentinia.

<shine|bm> hmm. i heared something about 150ppl
<Arlequin> what was the price for it?
<shine|bm> it was a big success. and i wasn't there... =)
<shine|bm> evoke97 was fun, too. we sat there with 70ppl in a room designed for 50 ;))
<Arlequin> ahahaha
<shine|bm> well, it was REALLY cool.
<shine|bm> hmm. entry price... about 29$ i guess. 
<shine|bm> check www.kaoz.org/evoke for details.
<Arlequin> 29$!@ wow.. :)
<Arlequin> we organized a party there.. the price was 5$, and we expected like 400 ppl... but only 
  assited arround 100 persons..
<Arlequin> and.. we still have to paying money to the place where we did the party

<Arlequin> have to sleep; recently come from a huge birthday-party
<Arlequin> if u c to zippy; say 'happy birthday' of my part :)
<shine|bm> hmm. i thought about releasing all my pics i haven't finished yet as joints, but most of them 
  i can't let go. these pics are mine and i don't like the idea that other artists finish it as the latest pics i 
  did were very personal to me.
<shine|bm> of cause i did joints, but i can't do in this case.
<shine|bm> yupp, i'll do. but it's tomorrow.
<Arlequin> i really dont care if anyone remix my ansis...
