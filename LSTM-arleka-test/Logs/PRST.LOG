<prst> if you still want to do an outline?
<prst> because your shading style is toony and the design is not in toonstyle shading .. ..

<prst> learn to use more f1,f2,f3 in your shading.
<Arlequin> about what ansis are u talking?
<prst> i used to think that they suck.. but when i knew how to use em. i canteven think in drawing 
  without em..
<prst> all of your works.
<Arlequin> i dont like f1, f2 usually
<prst> you do more plain colors ..
<Arlequin> yeah.. but it isnt.. toon shading.. :) dont know.. its a mix of all
<Arlequin> see us-np2.ans
<prst> if you check glue 1997 may pack you see that i shaded like you did
<Arlequin>  i like my shading.. and know how to do all types of shading, but simple.. i like mine :)
<prst> ok.. but still it's toon.
