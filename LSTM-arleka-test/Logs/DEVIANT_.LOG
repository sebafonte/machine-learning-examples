<Arlequin> I've been hearing some stories recently.  Stories that revolve around
<Arlequin> prelude's decision to disallow dualling of any form by their members.  Now
<Arlequin> one of these stories says that everyone has agreed to quit their other
<Arlequin> groups and go exclusive with prelude.
<Arlequin> That leaves me wondering what the situation is regarding those involved.  At
<Arlequin> the earliest possible opportunity, I'd like to be caught up on who is doing
<Arlequin> what.
<Arlequin> -whirr
<Arlequin> oh yeah, cain's getting he kick at the can this time, so don't forget to

<deviant`> this is some serious stuff, .. we're merging with remorse, or .. into remorse
<Arlequin> hrmn
<Arlequin> who decided it?
<deviant`> i and kaeslogic did, .. cause we were the only active leaders around
<Arlequin> and cleaner?
<Arlequin> it will be sad to have only two groups in the scene..
<deviant`> cleaner didn't like it, but he's really never around .. nothin bad about that, i know it's not his 
  faulty
<deviant`> and volatile told me he was going to the army, so i didn't really count his vote
<deviant`> but we will own, .. and i REALLY hope you're gonna go with the merge and join remorse 
  with me
<deviant`> i want to be in the same groups as you
<Arlequin> who is going to the army, volatile or cleaner?
<deviant`> volatile is
<Arlequin> but.. iam already in remorse :)
