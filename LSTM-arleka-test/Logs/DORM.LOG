   to cause prelude has a bad rep and everything now
<Arlequin> deefive is in prelude?
<dorm> i dont think so :)
<dorm> so.. where do we start with prelude?
<Arlequin> i dont have a fucking idea..
<Arlequin> i think that we have to contact ppl..
<Arlequin> and do a meeting
<dorm> yeah, tell them what has happened recently :) some of them dont even know about the merge
<Arlequin> hehhe
<Arlequin> iam lagged as hell
<dorm> :) theres one thing we gotta make clear though, i dont want to pick no shit with mimic or 
   remorse, i just want to kill them in the artscene
<Arlequin> okee dokie..
<Arlequin> iam not good at irc fighting.. so. .;)
<dorm> hhah :) me neither, so lets save it for the streets
<Arlequin> heeeeh
<dorm> .. i dont even have a member list with the emails, do you?
<Arlequin> probably yes... but i cant check right now.. if i jump to dos.. ill lost my connection (this 
  modem suxx)
