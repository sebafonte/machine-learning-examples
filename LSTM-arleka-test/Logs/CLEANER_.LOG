<cleaner_> yo man :)
<cleaner_> happy to see you
<Arlequin> hiya!!
<cleaner_> you know for remorse?
<Arlequin> sup?
<Arlequin> what happened?
<cleaner_> prelude is merging with remorse
<cleaner_> what do you think of this?
<Arlequin> ah?!
<cleaner_> please don't tell anyone yet
<Arlequin> so.. there will be only: remorse and mimic
<cleaner_> do you want to return to remorse??
<Arlequin> iam in remorse actually
<cleaner_> they kicked you man
<cleaner_> well listen to me
<cleaner_> i'm not going into remorse
<cleaner_> i'm against the merge
<Arlequin> me too
<cleaner_> i trust you, please don't tell anyone what i'll say to you
<Arlequin> second please
<cleaner_> ok
<cleaner_> don't tell deviant i'm speaking with you about that
<Arlequin> he is speaking me
<Arlequin> heeh ;)
<cleaner_> ok don't tell him or anyone i'm speaking to you about that
<Arlequin> okee np
<cleaner_> well would you be ok to follow me rather to rejoin remorse?
<cleaner_> ok
<Arlequin> why i was kicked?hoho
<cleaner_> i trust you 100% man, i'll tell you our project
<Arlequin> i still in the mailing list..
<Arlequin> okee :)
<cleaner_> you were kicked of remorse because you dualed with prelude, deviant told me that
<cleaner_> but if anyone learn the project, it'll fail
<cleaner_> ok
<cleaner_> then volatile don't wanna join remorse neither, he has left
<cleaner_> j2 is against the merge as well
<cleaner_> so is polygon
<cleaner_> then
<cleaner_> volatile and me are creating a new group
<cleaner_> dezibel would be oldschool head, and j2 would be newschool head, we still need to ask 
  them but it's pretty sure they'll accept
<cleaner_> we already have polygon as member
<cleaner_> both volatile and me want you to be a member
<Arlequin> deviant is sure to merge with remorse?
<cleaner_> sure
<cleaner_> (deviant`) we are mergin
<cleaner_> (deviant`) the merge is happening today, after remorse releases its pack
<Arlequin> i still with op
<Arlequin> i think that i werent kicked..
<cleaner_> strange
<cleaner_> deviant told me that you were kicked
<Arlequin> hrmnm
<cleaner_> because emok had to choose between the 2 groups
<cleaner_> emok is not in rmrs anymore cause he was in prelude
<cleaner_> zerostart choosed rmrs
