<[vince]> No.. As medicin..
<Arlequin> damn, explainme for what its used... i only know it for be used like a drug :)
<[vince]> For agoraphobia..
<[vince]> It CAN'T be used as a drug..
<[vince]> agoraphobia is what I use it for..
<[vince]> But it isn't a drug..
<[vince]> it makes me feel normal..
<Arlequin> i know; i mean, it can be used to get doped..
<[vince]> nothing more, nothing less..
<Arlequin> sorry my ignorance, whats agoraphobia? :)
<[vince]> You can't get doped on prozac...
<Arlequin> mix it with alcohol
<[vince]> Agoraphobia is when you feel uncomfortable in situations with people or whem you're not 
  in your own home...
<Arlequin> ah yeah.. i think that i know whats it now..
<[vince]> You can mix my medicine with alcohol.. (I'm doin my best right now =)..) it wont give any 
  extra effect..
<Arlequin> and, what effect it do? calm down?
<[vince]> I'll take this medicine for 2-3 years.. every day...
<[vince]> It makes me less "scared"
<[vince]> I don't really know how to spell it but it releaves my anxiuty
<Arlequin> anxiety?
<[vince]> wrong spelling but..
<[vince]> yep..
<[vince]> But.. Whatever I can do for you now, I'll be willing to do it..
<[vince]> If you need my help, that is..
<Arlequin> whats your actual email?
<Arlequin> i need anything to stay in contact frequently.. :)
<[vince]> I have no email right now... (Or.. I have one, but I cant remeber it =) )
<Arlequin> ahahah

<Arlequin> u can do one in hotmail.com, usa.net.. u know
<[vince]> You give me yours and I'll email mine..
<[vince]> Yeah,. I know..
<Arlequin> arlekpvm@hotmail.com
<[vince]> hey.. what do you know.. I still had it.. =)
<Arlequin> u mean, my email?
<[vince]> yep!
<Arlequin> ahhh, okee :)
<[vince]> But you no longer make ppe's?
<Arlequin> lemme explain..
<Arlequin> we will start to release sagain march..
<Arlequin> i have final exams soon, so.. have to use my time mainly for it..
<Arlequin> so, u are actually going to school, or what?
<[vince]> OK.. But if I learn JAVA it wont be in vain right?... Do you need java?
<Arlequin> sure we need :)
<[vince]> Ok.. My job will be VERY free 
<[vince]> So I can learn and do java, and get paid while doin it..
<Arlequin> its all right, at the moment all the group members are doing nothing.. :)
<[vince]> Ok.. But I don't like doin nothing =)
<Arlequin> me too ;)
<[vince]> I'm just sorry that I left whithout telling you..
<Arlequin> actually i think.. that will release all ppe's that we have in 'stock' (arround 20),.. and next 
  define the orientation of the group to another thing..
<[vince]> Ok.. 
<[vince]> I know ppe like my back pocket, but I'll rather program JAVA.. More of a challenge and 
  perhaps more useful..
<Arlequin> we actualy got a lot of members left:  sagittar (for yugoslavia): he is now studing at italy, 
  diamond darrell: he got a brain breeding, jm&sonik: they are actually only studing; lordnitro: he is 
  without his cablemode and ftp.. etc :)
<[vince]> That's good.. And the idea is to find your own private space of i-net and make it important..
<Arlequin> i dont know exactly.. what the group will be in the future.. sniff :)
<[vince]> Well. That's only a part of the challenge..
<Arlequin> have to eat now
<Arlequin> hope c u soon again
<Arlequin> if u need anything, emailme
