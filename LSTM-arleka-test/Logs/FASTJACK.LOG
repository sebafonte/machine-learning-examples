<Arlequin> long time no see..
<fastjack> heh. so at least i know your art. but i still cant figure out where we 'met =)
<Arlequin> u mean.. meet at 'real' life?!
<fastjack> he was on irc yesterday i think. well, his board went down becuz of some severe 
  hardware probs.
<fastjack> he, no i dont think so. i live in germany =)
<Arlequin> i know :)
<fastjack> so?
<Arlequin> damn, his bbs will back online?>
<fastjack> dunno. the german scene consists of about 20 ppl (maximum!) only like 10 calling boards. 
  with three active boards it is a bit lousy to run one...
<Arlequin> u kidding;.. i know more than 20 persons of the scene in germany :)
<Arlequin> or... u mean ansi scene?
<fastjack> ansi scene. 
<Arlequin> is boil, still live?
<fastjack> a german phone.company wanted to start the american like "free local calls" which would 
  be good for telnet but somehow they cancelled that, so that the german scene stays as isolated as it 
  was before...
<fastjack> well, me and jerusalem still exist but havent drawn much since that pack one year ago. we 
  plan to release a final "goodbye pack" this year.
<Arlequin> can sendme that pack please? (the latest one)
