<FlipSide> just writing my cellular phone number on IRC..
<FlipSide> Lot's of ppl called just for fun etc.. you know. Well
<FlipSide> Then this girl called..
<FlipSide> Christel, her name was
<FlipSide> I was 15 at that time, she 18
<FlipSide> =)
<FlipSide> So I was a little kid to her right?
<FlipSide> But..
<Arlequin> yeah
<FlipSide> Things went on
<FlipSide> I spoke more and more to her on the phone
<FlipSide> she lived 90 miles away from me
<FlipSide> so it was phone all day
<FlipSide> letters
<FlipSide> etc
<FlipSide> I asked if I could get a photo of her
<FlipSide> I got some photos
<FlipSide> She was really pretty
<FlipSide> and besides, she was the most perfect girl I've ever talked to ..  I mean.. In my eyes that is
<FlipSide> I really liked her
<FlipSide> and I grew more and more fond of her..
<FlipSide> I really liked her
<FlipSide> 1st of August I was 16
<Arlequin> i can imagine..
<FlipSide> We talked about (just for fun), getting engaged..
<FlipSide> :)
<FlipSide> Don't ask, I know it's sick
<FlipSide> well
<FlipSide> she bought rings
<FlipSide> sent one down to me
<FlipSide> still all-day talking in phone
<FlipSide> Then
<FlipSide> I started to think that it was useless.. or what it is..
<FlipSide> I mean..
<FlipSide> I could never be with her, i mean, for real
<FlipSide> so
<FlipSide> I  almost got together with another girl
<FlipSide> but..
<FlipSide> I went back to christel again
<FlipSide> after much things happening
<FlipSide> well
<FlipSide> she decided to visit me
<Arlequin> great! :)
<FlipSide> :)
<FlipSide> Yeah, that's what I thought too
<FlipSide> I was REALLY looking forward to uit
<FlipSide> I told her I couldn't imagine any1 else like her, she was perfect..
<FlipSide> both ways, physically and as a person to speak with
<FlipSide> I know no one knows more about me than her.
<FlipSide> well
<Arlequin> so, what happened?!
<FlipSide> sorry
<FlipSide> I got disconnected
<FlipSide> you got that driver license thing?
<Arlequin> nope, see:
<Arlequin> <FlipSide> both ways, physically and as a person to speak with
<Arlequin> <FlipSide> I know no one knows more about me than her.
<Arlequin> <FlipSide> well
<Arlequin> <Arlequin> so, what happened?!
<FlipSide> oh.. I'll copy-paste it
<FlipSide>  I was at a friends place for a weekend, she was supposed to drive on friday..
<FlipSide> e> it's about 10 hours of driving
<FlipSide> <FlipSide> she had just gotten the driver's license
<FlipSide> <FlipSide> and should drive together with her father, she in her new-bought car
<FlipSide> <FlipSide> sorry
<FlipSide> there
<FlipSide> well..
<Arlequin> with his father? and she will meet ya at your friends house?
<FlipSide> she should arrive at about 5 in the morning (saturday)
<FlipSide> Her father was supposed to go to her brother's place... he lives not so far from my city
<FlipSide> she was supposed to live at a apartment in the city
<FlipSide> but that weekend she should be where we were
<FlipSide> I went to sleep for an hour at 04:30
<FlipSide> she never arrived that weekend.
<FlipSide> She had, infact, never been driving
<FlipSide> she don't even have a driverlicense
<FlipSide> and her father knew NOTHING
<FlipSide> I phoned him when I was wondering what the heck was happening
<Arlequin> to his father or she?
<Arlequin> ia mena, her or him? 
<Arlequin> mean
<FlipSide> I phoned the gas station we had told here to turn left when she saw it, to check if the car 
  was ther, that she was sleepy and had stopped to get some rest
<FlipSide> but nothing there
<FlipSide> what you mean
<FlipSide> I phoned her father
<FlipSide> I got his cellular phone number
<FlipSide> She didn't have a car, nor she had driver license
<FlipSide> When i spoke with her on the phone
<FlipSide> and i thought she was on her way down
<FlipSide> she was doped on tablets
<FlipSide> trying to commit suicide.. or what it is... kill herself
<Arlequin> arghhhhh damn!!
<Arlequin> why the fuck she want suicide?!?!
<FlipSide> I then tried to phone here all sunday
<FlipSide> her phone was OFF:.
<FlipSide> I got more and more worried
<FlipSide> Then - 
<FlipSide> I mean.. saturday i tried to phone her all day
<FlipSide> at night she finally turned the phone on
<FlipSide> She told me she was in a hospital
<FlipSide> mental hospital
<FlipSide> suffering manic depressives.. (is that the name of it?)
<FlipSide> Atleast that was what the doctors there said first
<FlipSide> l8r they found that she wasn't suffering that 
<FlipSide> (this is only the beginning..)
<FlipSide> oh shit.,. she just came on IRC:.
<FlipSide> fuck..
<FlipSide> Well..
<FlipSide> i'll go on telling you..
<FlipSide> hmm
<FlipSide> yes
<FlipSide> she went to a rest-home for a month or two or something
<FlipSide> then we agreed that she should come down to me at christmas
<FlipSide> what?
<FlipSide> I dunno..
<Arlequin> sorry
<FlipSide> A lot of shitty things had happened in her childhood..
<Arlequin> i was lagged
<FlipSide> sexually abused by her uncle and stuff
<FlipSide> She had tried to do it several times.. suicide
<FlipSide> b4 that
<FlipSide> But i didn't know it at that time
<FlipSide> okey
<FlipSide> she couldn't come at christmas
<FlipSide> still alot of phone talking
<FlipSide> my friends couldn't understand how I could talk to her still
<FlipSide> when she had lied that much
<FlipSide> but..
<FlipSide> well..
<FlipSide> i don't know..
<FlipSide> I just forgave her.. told her I was willing to try again.
<FlipSide> 'Cause I REALLY DIDN*T WANT TO LOOSE her..
<FlipSide> I knew I would never be able to get together with another girl.. alot of shit I think sound 
  stupdi nowadays..
<FlipSide> Well
<FlipSide> Some of my friends thought she was some kind of psycho
<FlipSide> hmm
<FlipSide> I don't know where to continue.. hmm.. well
<FlipSide> She was coming to visit me..
<FlipSide> once more
<FlipSide> this time it was true
<FlipSide> she was on the train
<FlipSide> I jumped some forward here... it was somekind of a dead-period...
<Arlequin> ok
<FlipSide> another friend of mine (he had been talking alot to her in the phone, he also liked her alot)
<FlipSide> was at my place
<FlipSide> the day she was coming
<FlipSide> the phone rings
<FlipSide> she's talking, telling me she's in town..
<FlipSide> And she really was, she named some of the stores around the train station
<FlipSide> but then she suddenly says a car with some friends are stopping to pick her up.. She had 
  du hang up, bye.
<FlipSide> hmm
<FlipSide> then..
<FlipSide> we hear DNOTHING
<FlipSide> she said she was going to call me
<FlipSide> but she didnt'...
<FlipSide> not later that night
<FlipSide> I was up all night, trying to call her
<Arlequin> what the fuck, it was pathetic..
<FlipSide> Fearing that she maybe was trying to kill her self again
<FlipSide> what was pathetic? me being up all night?
<FlipSide> then suddenly we managed to reach her in the morning... 05:00 or something
<FlipSide> she said she had been sleeping at a friends place, forgetting to call..
<FlipSide> we accepted that.. (she was weary after 13hours in train etc)
<FlipSide> hmm
<FlipSide> We should meet her at a internet-cafe in the city after school that day
<FlipSide> oh, I had also spent a lot of money on a present to her
<FlipSide> which I was looking forward to give her
<FlipSide> hmm
<Arlequin> i mean, that was pathetic that she didnt call ya
<FlipSide> I went to the city
<FlipSide> Really excited
<FlipSide> oh, ok
<FlipSide> walking insied the netcafe
<FlipSide> ...she was NOT there..
<FlipSide> just my mate
<FlipSide> and some other ppl
<FlipSide> oh
<FlipSide> She also told us
<FlipSide> that a friend of her would be there, Kari was her name
<FlipSide> and she was REALLY big, she told us
<FlipSide> She was there, I figured..
<FlipSide> Yep.. she was.
<FlipSide> I talked a bit to both of them
<FlipSide> Kenneth and Kari (Kenneth is the mate, at my place the night before)
<FlipSide> No one of them knew where she was..
<FlipSide> She didn't show up later either
<FlipSide> and..
<FlipSide> The phone was OFF, of course..
<FlipSide> and..
<FlipSide> To us, she had said that she was supposed to stay with a friend, Kathinka her names 
  was..
<FlipSide> name, even
<FlipSide> to Kari, she said she was going to b somewhere in the neighbourcity
<FlipSide> hmm.. 
<FlipSide> We got the number to this Kathinka
<FlipSide> She hadn't heard anything from Christel in a looong time..
<FlipSide> SHe hadn't been there..
<FlipSide> we had no idea where she could be elsewhere
<FlipSide> Also

  uncle
<FlipSide> The next day I didn't go to school, I felt I couldn't make that..
<FlipSide> I hadn't slept that night
<FlipSide> I didn't sleep the next, (only one hour or two)
<FlipSide> Then
<FlipSide> Kari had been at that netcafe for two days

<FlipSide> one half hour later
<FlipSide> Both Kari and Allis comes in

<FlipSide> sHe says: ... how am I gonna say this..
<FlipSide> Then...
<FlipSide> SHe throws the ring saying : "Yours, ALexander, 01.12.98"  (My name is Alexander)
<FlipSide> .........
<FlipSide> Kari was christel
<FlipSide> No wonder we didn't find her..

<FlipSide> SHe said: You hate me..?
<FlipSide> I could'nt say a word..
<FlipSide> I felt totally EMPTY
<FlipSide> Then she started to cry
<FlipSide> I heard Allis was sitting down, talking to my parents..
<FlipSide> Saying that I was going to go thru a hard time, feeling betrayed etc.
<FlipSide> Well..
<FlipSide> Then Christel and Kari had to leave
<FlipSide> When she had left
<FlipSide> ,
<FlipSide> I started to cry

<FlipSide> I didn't have to pay them back..
<FlipSide> But he has told Christel that he doesn't want to hear anything more from her.. So has her

  ppl I've never met b4, being together in one of us' house...

<FlipSide> continue what, listen what?
<Arlequin> nevermind.. :)
<FlipSide> =)
<FlipSide> the dcc is still going strong..
<Arlequin> i think.. that the best that u can do is.. start to use sequensers... 
<Arlequin> and pro things.. like GIGAsampler..
<FlipSide> But..
<FlipSide> where should I get money to  that..?
<FlipSide> I don't have the clue about seq's and samplers..
<FlipSide> NEVER used any of'em
<Arlequin> i mean.. sequencers 'software'
<FlipSide> Oh... anything to recommend..?
<Arlequin> GIGA sampler, hrmnm lemme remember
<FlipSide> I've read about the GIGA sampler.. but that is  hardware..
<Arlequin> cubase 3.5 vst
<FlipSide> Cubase.. that's MIDI.-..
<FlipSide> MIDI + SB16 = wuah..
<Arlequin> its a midi sequencer
<FlipSide> ...yeah?
<Arlequin> i know some budds that was working with ft2... but they emigred now to midi standart
14__[5crEEd14_)1: you just received filename (partuza.gif) from reduz
<Arlequin> to do 'professional' things
<FlipSide> Hey, ft2 can be almost just as pro as midi... 
<FlipSide> but..
<FlipSide> I agree that it doesn't beat it..
<FlipSide> But..
<FlipSide> If that should happen
<FlipSide> I need money to pay may speakers... I still have some money to pay there
<FlipSide> I need a better coputer
<FlipSide> computer even
<FlipSide> I need a better soundcard
<FlipSide> Right now all I have is a p90, 32megz Ram, 5,2gigs hd, and this lousy 4x cdrom,
<Arlequin> speakers?!?! u have pro ones..

<FlipSide> Hmm... 
<FlipSide> About my tracking..
<FlipSide> I think I'm having this period again...
<FlipSide> Like... I do not like anything I've tracked..
<FlipSide> Hmm...
<FlipSide> And my life...
<FlipSide> Heh..
<FlipSide> I'm getting more and more aware of what Sick_girl (Christel) has done to me.. How much it 
  hurts...
<FlipSide> heh.. sounds like some cheap TV series..
<FlipSide> but..
<Arlequin> hehe sick_girl
<FlipSide> I'm kinda feeling like... BURNING all her letters.. And I will do that...
<FlipSide> And the engagement ring...
<FlipSide> I'll have it sold or something...
<FlipSide> I mean... Phsycic (if that's how it's written... Like.. my head, my thoughts) I'm getting more 
  and more down...

<Arlequin> and.. what about that new girl that u meet at a 'party'?
<FlipSide> Hmm.. Anette?
<Arlequin> yeah
<FlipSide> yeah.. I really like her...
<FlipSide> SHe's... heh... normal..
<FlipSide> She's at my own age
<FlipSide> she looks OK, I would say she's pretty,
<FlipSide> not pretty as in: GOD DAMN!
<FlipSide> but..
<FlipSide> heh..
<FlipSide> hard to xplain
<FlipSide> And I think (hope) that she likes me too.. So .. maybe that's what I need now... A normal 
  girl, and a normal relationship
<Arlequin> re send that mp3 please :)
<FlipSide> okey..!
<FlipSide> So... enuff about my life...
<FlipSide> yours..? and your tracking?
<Arlequin> i feel kinda depressed.. becouse.. i have to re-course a year of school..
<Arlequin> and i never tracked :) i only stay attempt to tracked music... i do graphic art
<FlipSide> whoa... Sorry to hear that man...
<FlipSide> okey..
<FlipSide> I still do some gfx too... 3d..
<FlipSide> =)
<FlipSide> I know,
<FlipSide> that if I would have to re-course this year...
<FlipSide> I wouldn't make it...
<Arlequin> why?
<FlipSide> Because...
<Arlequin> i probably will take the year free.. and use it for study english.. and some other shit that i 
  like.. :)
<FlipSide> heh... I just wouldn't make it... It's alright enough this year, but a LOT is boring,...
<FlipSide> lot's of mathematics
<FlipSide> hehe
<FlipSide> okey
<Arlequin> oh yeah.. i go to a electronics technicians school :) i see lot of maths too
<FlipSide> That's what I'm going now..
<FlipSide> Electronics
<FlipSide> I think it's the same thing
<FlipSide> =)
<Arlequin> :)
<FlipSide> all these formulas for finding out things about those different components... ahw..
<FlipSide> =)
<Arlequin> anyway.. i wont continue electronics at university.. its too hard/bored for me :)
<FlipSide> okey.. I understand you..
