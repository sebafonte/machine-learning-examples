<Roy[SAC]> and he was one, who was not ever correct to the newbes
<Roy[SAC]> remember the text i wrote in the sac pack 17 nfo
<Arlequin> yeah
<Arlequin> but..
<Arlequin> i think that sqz did a part of prestige in latest times of sac..
<Roy[SAC]> antibody started a anti sac campain.. and much guys are angry now.. okay.. but i had 
  have to do something.. coz as sac was in the last month wasnt acceotable
<Arlequin> i know, antibody invited me to df2 hehe :)
<Arlequin> but.. sqz.. dont know.. i never thinked like a posibility that sqz could be kicked.
<Roy[SAC]> at first i liked antibody really and wanted to help him.. coz he was a bit aeh.. depressed..
<Roy[SAC]> but now..
<Roy[SAC]> its not understandable for me..
<Roy[SAC]> tsts
<Roy[SAC]> but anyway.. antibody joined as VGA artist
<Roy[SAC]> but he did nothing
<Roy[SAC]> and be honest... his ascii stuff was not good
<Arlequin> yeah
