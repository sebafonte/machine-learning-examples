<Antibody> oh. well.. i guess i am a bit too.
<Antibody> and when i seek new options in the ascii scene im met with these arguements
<Antibody> <zerohour> nO eUROS.
<Antibody> <nM4NCEr> IT'S ALRIGHT THOUGH, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANY EUROS IN

<Antibody> i didnt get any from you.
<Antibody> maybe i can get one now?
<Arlequin> yeah
<Antibody> well.. ?
<Antibody> check your log then :)
<Arlequin> fuck.. what answer, repeat them :)
<Antibody> <Antibody> i am tired of staying in SAC (which is dying in INTRO REQUESTS; we haven't 
  had one for 6 months, and they just close their eyes on it.) and i want to get into something "new", 
  such as the artscene, whatever.
<Antibody> well i was waiting for your feedback 
<Arlequin> did u looked at demos? :)
<Arlequin> man.. u live in denmark.. u have in your country one of the biggest demo partys in the 
  world...
<Antibody> err what has that to do with the issue?
<Arlequin> "and i want to get into something "new", such as the artscene, whatever."
<Antibody> yeah i ment group
<Arlequin> ahh :)
<Antibody> like a group with more contact to the artscene, whatever..
<Arlequin> u can join circe.. dunno :) there isnt nothing new or that can be qualified like a 'revolution'
<Antibody> hmm
<Antibody> how about karma? 
<Antibody> hehe.
<Arlequin> yeah.. karma is the oppositive to remorse, mimic and other faggots ascii groups 
<Antibody> howcome you're not in it? 
<Arlequin> i was.. but
<Arlequin> i want to mantain my op.. staying in remorse.. for.. soon start a fight with #ascii fascists 
  like black jack, serial toon, meatpod, etc
<Antibody> oh
<Antibody> hms arle
<Antibody> how about starting a new group with the same standards as Karma
<Antibody> as side project.
<Arlequin> i  cant... i dont have time.. and dont want.. its suficient for me with pvm, circe.. and 
  organizing the party here :)
<Antibody> true
<Antibody> the problem is
<Antibody> that groups as karma, remorse,.. they dont give shit about hi ascii.
<Arlequin> what u mean?
<Antibody> what i mean is
<Antibody> it's not respected.
<Arlequin> ascii, or what?
<Antibody>  HI ascii
