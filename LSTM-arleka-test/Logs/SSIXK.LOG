<ssixk> want to join my group?
<Arlequin> what group? :)
<ssixk> i'm serious, you want to?
<ssixk> this is disco btw.
<ssixk> well, i want to start a group
<ssixk> but i just want it to be with people i consider to be friends, etc.
<ssixk> havent thought of a name
<ssixk> it's not really important right now
<ssixk> but the basic idea is there will be a voted upon release date every month/2 months.. etc
<Arlequin> in ascii or ansi?
<ssixk> both
<ssixk> doesnt matter
<ssixk> anything really

<Arlequin> actually iam full of ansis with circe...
<Arlequin> and dunno about ascii..
<Arlequin> can be, not sure.. :)
<s6k> i'm tired of groups.
<s6k> so i just want to do one that's appealing to me for once
<s6k> and most likely, appealing to others
<s6k> i mean, it's just basic freedom
<s6k> you can do whatever, whenever.
<s6k> i'm doing a remix pack with j2 and m7m (or atleast, we've agreed to do one)
<s6k> and that'll be on top of this.. it's just you know, pack size isn't important
<s6k> quality isn't important
<Arlequin> i want do some remixes too
<s6k> just putting something out there is
<s6k> alright, you can do the remix pack too :)
<s6k> we've just agreed to do one
<Arlequin> neat :)
<s6k> j2's gonna be back in  a week or so he said
<Arlequin> i will remix some ansis and asciis
<s6k> so we're gonna talk about it more then
<Arlequin> okee
<s6k> word man.
<s6k> but yeah, think about joining.
<s6k> it'll be neat.
<Arlequin> okee :)
