<Arlequin> I've been hearing some stories recently.  Stories that revolve around
<Arlequin> prelude's decision to disallow dualling of any form by their members.  Now
<Arlequin> one of these stories says that everyone has agreed to quit their other
<Arlequin> groups and go exclusive with prelude.
<Arlequin> That leaves me wondering what the situation is regarding those involved.  At
<Arlequin> the earliest possible opportunity, I'd like to be caught up on who is doing
<Arlequin> what.
<Arlequin> -whirr
<Arlequin> oh yeah, cain's getting he kick at the can this time, so don't forget to
<Arlequin> send your work to him.

<Arlequin>         Hey, what the fuck?
<Arlequin>         
<Arlequin>         Why would any of you who have been a part of this group over 
<Arlequin> the last few months, and have seen what is going on and how we're 
<Arlequin> succeeding in improving, forming family and etc even consider 
<Arlequin> joining prelude?.. 
<Arlequin>         As far as I'm concerned, Prelude should merge into Remorse, 
<Arlequin> that stupid little group.
<Arlequin>         And yeah, SEND ME YOUR ASCII, LET'S ROCK MARCH 
<Arlequin> BABY. That's my birthday month, yo.
<Arlequin> -cain-
