<avengah> back again, got a phonecall
<Arlequin> waiting call service? :)
<avengah> sorry?
<avengah> i just dropped the line, because phoning costs a lot of money
<Arlequin> ah.. yeah..
<avengah> so i decided to wait this 5 mins until i relogged on
<Arlequin> zippy tellme something
<avengah> it sucks =)
<Arlequin> fuck, yeah...
<Arlequin> its more expensive than there..
<_ave|bm> where are you from?
<Arlequin> argentina
<_ave|bm> ah
<_ave|bm> is there a large argentinian scene? :)
<Arlequin> no really :)
<Arlequin> in past december was our first scene party..
<Arlequin> i mean, demoparty.. u know
<_ave|bm> sure, german scene is quite big and we had a lot demoparties already
<_ave|bm> back to c64 and so =)
<Arlequin> i know...
<Arlequin> how its called, the biggest demoscene party in germany..
<_ave|bm> next month i큟 going to ambience in the netherlands and easter there is mekka / 
  symposium
<_ave|bm> it큦 most time a lot of fun
<Arlequin> i think to go to some demosceneparty next year.. in europe..
<Arlequin> i was trhinking about the party, in denmark..
<_ave|bm> i attented tp7 
<_ave|bm> it was boring for me
<_ave|bm> few germans had been there and my friends were all busy coding their demos and stuff
<_ave|bm> but it큦 actually cool to have such a lot of people (there were about 5000) gathering
<_ave|bm> sadly most of them were kiddies playing games over the network or leeching porn
<Arlequin> yeah
<Arlequin> i hate that...
<Arlequin> in that local scene party... a lot of ppl was playing duke nukem and shit all time..
<_ave|bm> i mean you can play games at home - it큦 much cooler to sit together and drink something
<_ave|bm> or even be creative
<_ave|bm> you know
<Arlequin> hehe yeah..
<_ave|bm> i have to admit that i dont know much about argentinia.. is it (compared to other 
  southamerican states) wealthy or poor?
<Arlequin> its not much poor, compared with other states of southamerica.. its hrmn the best one... 
  but anyway.. the economy is going down fast in the latest years..
<_ave|bm> oh.
<Arlequin> so... 
<Arlequin> why being germany a first world country... have very expensive the phone?
<_ave|bm> because german telecom had been a government company for a long time, they had a 
  monopol
<_ave|bm> and since a year telekom got "private" (independent from government) and other 
  companies
<_ave|bm> are allowed to come on the market
<_ave|bm> it큦 slowly getting cheaper
<Arlequin> yeah.. there is a monopoly.. but no from the goverment :)
<Arlequin> btw..
<Arlequin> how is the thing.. between kolor and blakc maiden?
<Arlequin> u are all friends?
<_ave|bm> more or less, noize has been in black maiden and then went to kolor
<_ave|bm> lord chaos and shiva are in bm and kolor
<_ave|bm> we know each other quite well.
<_ave|bm> i wont say everyone큦 everyone큦 friend, but that큦 naturally , because bm has over 20 
  members
<_ave|bm> but kolor is the demogroup we have the best contact to
<Arlequin> have to go..
<Arlequin> laters
<_ave|bm> ok see you
