<disco74> hey
<Arlequin> wassup?
<disco74> nothing much
<disco74> just got banned from #ans because i noted that jandor used gif2ascii
<disco74> and tr is being a little bitch about it
<Arlequin> hey.. what about the new group?
<disco74> I dont know what i'm going to do now..
<Arlequin> hrmn, u lesft remorse?
<disco74> they kicked me out
<disco74> they didnt even tell me i was kicked out
<disco74> they didnt have the decency to do that.
<disco74> I still want to start a group
<disco74> but i'm going to wait until i settle some shit..
<Arlequin> ascii?
<disco74> for now i'm probably going to join karma.. I was talking with ant1k and mankind yesterday, 
  and i hinted at the idea and they seemed fine to it.
<disco74> yeah, ascii group
<Arlequin> oka
<Arlequin> man, circe deadline is in 29 december, be ready :)
<disco74> i will.
<disco74> you still in remorse?
<Arlequin> yeah, where ill join if not..
<Arlequin> ant1k and mandkind get angry becoz i left karma.. and i never will join mimic
<disco74> hmm, I was just going to suggest you re-join karma.. 
<disco74> I mean, it's better than the alternatives
<disco74> well, for now atleast :)
<Arlequin> bah, i dont care at least.. for the moment :)
<disco74> thats cool..
<disco74> But they're going to treat you like shit in remorse since they suspect you were in on 
  odelay.. Since black jack told them everything
<Arlequin> how the fuck blakc jack noticed?
<disco74> because mimic was like half dead, so i talked to him about a possible merge.. 
<disco74> and WHILE i was talking to him about that he was talking with whirr about the whole thing
<Arlequin> what a stupid nigga
<disco74> yeah, thats why i'm putting odelay off.. I want to deal with him first
